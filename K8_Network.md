# CNI(Container Runtime Interface)
	1. Conatiner runtime must create a network namespace
	2. Identify network the conatiner must attach to
	3. Conatiner Runtime to invoke Network Plugin (bridge) when conatiner is ADDed
	4. Conatiner Runtime to invoke Network Plugin (bridge) when conatiner is DELeted
	5. JSON format of the Network Configuration
	6. Must support command line arguments Add/Del/Check
	7. Must support parameter conatiner id, network ns etc.
	8. Must manage IP address assignment to PODs
	9. Must Return results in a specific format
	
		- However docker doesnâ€™t support CNI, docker has its own container network model(CNM) same as CNI with some differences.
		- When k8 cluster runs a conatiner in docker runtime, by default it set --network=none and later it assign a bridge to the container.

	**Example**

	```
	docker run --network=none nginx
	bridge add 2e34dcf34 /var/run/netns/2e34dcf34
	```
